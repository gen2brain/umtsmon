ADVANCED TRICKS FOR UMTSMON
===========================

WARNING: Do not use these tricks unless you need to.




CONTENTS:
---------
1. override autodetection ports
2. non-gui things
  a.  set custom CID
  b.  use priviledged pppd options and 'call'




1. override autodetection ports
-------------------------------
To be written, see the man page for --serial=



2a. Set custom CID
-------------------

For connections with some USB connections to cell phones, one needs to set
the "CID" to a different number than 1 - because "1" is already taken by 
the phone.

WHEN DO YOU NEED IT:
  if you cannot make a connection and looking at the log, you see
  ERROR as answer following the "AT+CGDCONT=1," Query...

WHAT TO DO:
  * open ~/.umtsmon/umtsmonrc
  * find your profile. It should be in the [ConnectionProfiles] Section.
  * it has entries in the form of PROFILENAME/prof/KEY=VALUE
  * add the following two lines in there (and replace PROFILENAME):
      PROFILENAME/prof/CIDprefix=###
      PROFILENAME/prof/CID=2
   Where the ### should be replaced by your CID. The most obvious candidates
   are: 
      *99
      *99*** (umtsmon uses this one as default)
      *99*

2b. Use priviledged pppd options and 'call'
-------------------------------------------

WHEN DO YOU NEED IT:
  * If you need "noauth" or other priviledged options to pppd
  * If you need other pppd options that the umtsmon Profile dialog does
    not provide.

WHAT TO DO:
The below explains what to do for adding noauth. If you need other
things, please think first and then do what you need.
(as root):
  * go to /etc/ppp/peers
  * echo "noauth" > umtsmoncustom

(as yourself, i.e. a normal user): 
  * open ~/.umtsmon/umtsmonrc
  * find the Section [ConnectionProfiles]
  * add the following for your active profile (identified in that section as
    ActiveProfile=...)
      PROFILENAME/prof/call=umtsmoncustom

If you now start umtsmon with the -v5 option, make a connection and quit 
umtsmon, you should now see in the logs that pppd also used the above.
