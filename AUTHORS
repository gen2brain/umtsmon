However, Klaas is not the only copyright holder as some parts were derived

implementation topics or did supply patches or translations. 
This file tries to list those contributions:

The 'Runner' code to run other programs from umtsmon, specifically the piece to communicate

Icons in the images/{16|22|SVG} directories come from the Tango icon
set, available at: http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library
