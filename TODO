TODO

This file contains a list of things to be done and a list of what's done
already.
Any entry starting with an X is completed.
Any entry starting with an / is "half" completed


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 0.10 release:
 X suspend logging during setting PIN/PUK.
 X add checks whether user is part of 'dialout' and 'uucp' groups
 X BUG TO BE REPORTED:
   - even if *time* limit is hit, still data limit mentioned in warning dialog.
   - that dialog is not i18n aware
 X BUG:
   X  ###P1 t=935: ERROR: APN contains illegal character
      this error should be visible to the GUI user, too.
   X  it also means that the checks in the profile dialog need to improve
 X Create a new popup class that saves whether the customer wants to see the dialog again
   X add a "welcome" at umtsmon start
   X add a "please create a profile" at gui start 
 X Sierra Wireless Aircard 875 returns a number (I saw 23201 once) as operator - that should be masked...
   - Novatel devices do this, too
   - Huawei also sometimes
   * (observed on Novatel cards only): if subsequent calls to AT+COPS do not return
     the operator namei (but an empty string), make sure you cached the previous instance.
     NOTE: first research why - this might be due to CREG/CGREG or so...
   X implement number-to-operator cache
   X use cache
 X on single port cards (maybe also on multi-port cards)
   not having autoupdate radio prefs on, will hang umtsmon after
   shutting down the network connection
 X I18n changes:
   X make setting for non-en_US language persistent
   X get list of all possible languages
   X add menu option to set language from GUI
   * Indonesian, thanks to Andika Triwidada
   * Russian, thanks to Soussine Viktor
 X auto connect option
   X only allow auto connect when previously a connection was successful for that profile
   X ensure device switching can be automated, too
 X hardware enablement:
   X finish Option HSO device support
   X Solomon SCMi 250u   
   X Ericsson F3507g
 X add Device class name and port info to System info dialog
 X remember if roaming last time, so can show right stats at startup
 * ConnectionInfo(ACM) - if a device doesn't work well on CGREG, we should make
   the registration be part of the signal quality. i.e. always ask for signal quality
   and make the registration depend on that. This requires changing the isDeviceRegistered()
   and other members.
 * ConnectionInfoACM seems to work as fine as ConnectionInfo does. Why have two?
   - of course not entirely true: roaming info is missing
 * BUG:
   *  Huawei modems no longer understand roaming vs home network
 X various bugs fixed and optimizations around profiles:
   - better handling of empty APN
   - ability to set a profile from the command line
   - immediately edit a profile after you create a new one
 X CID is now configurable from the config file 
 X umtsmon no longer requires device to be fully operational at start
   the device can now even be inserted after umtsmon has started
 * The UI is sluggish
   - move autodetection to a separate background thread
   - fix the UIState to become a proper state machine
 X allow for extra options in ppp through the /etc/ppp/peers file
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
For "FUTURE RELEASES":
 * really make Aircard 875 (860/881U) work
 * umtsmon crashes when a system comes out of suspend
 * network operator wizard should also retrieve signal info for all operators
 * check if the output of usb_modeswitch was good - or do we need to run again?
 * auto update of stats should be always enabled until registered.
 * check if UMTS card is forced to a specific network because if that
   network is not available, you won't get a connection automatically
 * Fix network selection of Novatel XU870
 * move testersettings stuff from the various *_main.cpp files  to TestFrame.cpp
 * TO BE REPORTED BUG: when a usb serial plug is inserted *AND* a usb2serial-based card like the
   Option, the new autodetection code will decide ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB3 first.
   the test for AT will fail - the card will only use ttyUSB3. Not good.
 / Fix flickering of LCDDisplay
 * add a dialog that shows the progress of AutoDetect
 * on single port cards, a malfunctioning PPP might leave the port in undefined state
 * fix operation on 2.6.20 kernels (Bug #1662877)
 * check if HSDPA is used and show in display
 * if multiple Profiles exist, make the "Connect" button a drop-down or add a dialog.
   * show the currently selected Profile on the mainwindow
 * add a "STOP" feature that kills all network connections and
   performs a "cardctl eject" command - only if pcmcia kernel module is loaded
   note: "cardctl eject" on Suse 9.3, "pccardctl eject" on Suse 10.1
   note: on Suse, this command is suid root, but we can run things as root anyway now
   -> this feature should only exist for PCMCIA, as it makes no sense on USB
   -> this feature is dangerous on nozomi cards as it might freeze the whole system
 * fix compilation for QT4 (Bug # 1527835)
   -> only go to QT4 if it doesn't impact the amount of required libraries
 * remove all assert(false) from the code
 * Wizards for PPP configuration
 * SMS handling:
   * do code page translation as the character sets don't match
   * add receiving SMS
 * Make single serial port cards co-exist with PPP
   (not by mutual exclusion as it is now, but by interrupting data streams)
   See note in SerialPort.cpp: This code can be derived from modem.cpp in kppp.
   Reportedly, also OpenMoko's gsmd can do this for us.
 * more graphics
   - animated connect and search network graphics?
   - adjust font sizes for DPI settings in LCDDisplay
 * diagnose more configuration errors
 * installers
 * (See Bug 1856802) for some device/operator, the MTU changes between GPRS and
   UMTS operation.    The only workaround is currently to set a fixed MTU in 
   the file /etc/ppp/options, which then is used for both radio modes.
 * add location identification, like shown in this application:

History of releases:
 
What was in the  0.1 release:
 X enter pin code during startup to unlock the card
 X switching of network operators

 X command line override of autodetection
 X create basic website
 X if umtsmon is started immediately after card was inserted, the SIM
   interface might not have been initialised yet. That's currently handled 
   incorrectly: we *should* allow some time and poll for the interface to 
   become available.
